Hi, I'm Nitin Ratnakaran. 

I'm a software enthusiast and I love exploring and learning about Java, microservices, cloud and software architecture. They say that you haven't really understood something unless you can explain it to others. And thats why I started writing this blog site. 

I hope that the little bytez of knowledge that I collect and share can be useful to others looking for the same answers. 

So please feel free to explore, comment and share. Happy reading !!

You can also reach out to me via any of the links given on the left.
