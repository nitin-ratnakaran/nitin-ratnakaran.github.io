## Four different types of gateways â€“

### Amazon S3 File Gateway,

Amazon S3 File Gateway presents a file interface that enables you to store files as objects in Amazon S3 using the industry-standard NFS and SMB file protocols, and access those files via NFS and SMB from your data center or Amazon EC2, or access those files as objects directly in Amazon S3.

#### Benefits

- Extends the AWS Cloud to your datacenter
- Requires no changes to existing applications
- Reduces physical infrastructure, cost and complexity

### Amazon FSx File Gateway,

Amazon FSx File Gateway provides fast, low-latency on-premises access to fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file shares in the cloud using the industry-standard SMB protocol.
